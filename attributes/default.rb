# The log_format directive describes the format of a log entry. You can use
# general variables in the format, as well as variables which exist only at the
# moment of writing into the log:
#
#   * $body_bytes_sent, the number of bytes, transmitted to client minus the
#   response headers. This variable is compatible with the %B parameter of
#   Apache's mod_log_config (this was called $apache_bytes_sent, before version
#   0.3.10)
#   * $bytes_sent, the number of bytes transmitted to client
#   * $connection, the number of connection
#   * $msec, the current time at the moment of writing the log entry
#   (microsecond accuracy)
#   * $pipe, "p" if request was pipelined
#   * $request_length, the length of the body of the request
#   * $request_time, the time it took nginx to work on the request, in seconds
#   with millisecond precision (just seconds for versions older than 0.5.19)
#   * $status, status of answer
#   * $time_iso8601, time in ISO 8601 format, e. g. 2011-03-21T18:52:25+03:00
#   (added in 0.9.6)
#   * $time_local, local time into common log format.
#
# The headers, transmitted to client, begin from the prefix "sent_http_", for
# example, $sent_http_content_range.
#
# Note that variables produced by other modules can also be logged. For example
# you can log upstream response headers with the prefix "upstream_http_", see

# A worker process is a single-threaded process.

# If Nginx is doing CPU-intensive work such as SSL or gzipping and you have 2

# fully utilize disk bandwidth.

# worker_cpu_affinity.
#
# Nginx has the ability to use more than one worker process for several

#   * to use SMP
#   * to decrease latency when workers blockend on disk I/O
#   * to limit number of connections per process when select()/poll() is used

# browsers to close the connection, so that the server does not have to.
# Without this parameter, nginx does not send a Keep-Alive header (though this
# is not what makes a connection "keep-alive").
#
# The parameters can differ from each other.
#
# Notes on how browsers handle the Keep-Alive header:
#   * MSIE and Opera ignore the "Keep-Alive: timeout=<N>" header.
#   * MSIE keeps the connection alive for about 60-65 seconds, then sends a TCP RST.
#   * Opera keeps the connection alive for a long time.
#   * Mozilla keeps the connection alive for N plus about 1-10 seconds.
#   * Konqueror keeps the connection alive for about N seconds.
#
#   Every browser, and every version of each browser, has a
#   different timeout the use for keep alives. Firewalls also have their own
#   connection timeouts which may be shorter then the keep alives set on either
#   the client or server. This means browsers, servers and firewalls all have
#   to be in alignment so that keeps alives work. If not, the browser will try
#   to request something over a connection which will never work which results
#   in pausing and slowness for the user. Goolge Chrome got around this timeout
#   issue by sending a keepalive every 45 seconds until the browser's default

# puts you in it's connection pool but does not respond to you with anything
# beyond that. Be careful though not to set this too low, as your proxy server
# might take a longer time to respond to requests on purpose (e.g. when serving
